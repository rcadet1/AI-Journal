Week 2
This week I used AI to research Instagram tags for my baseball clips so they
reach the right audience. I asked ChatGPT for niche + broad hashtag mixes
#baseball, #mlb, #baseballtraining and intent tags that match my content
#hittingdrills, #outfieldwork, #velo, #batpath. I also requested location
team variants and trend adjacent tags tied to current players and moments
e.g., #Postseason, #HomerunDerby when relevant. I did not copy lists
blindly I trimmed to 8–12 tags per post and kept them aligned to the actual
video.

I also used AI to draft 2 caption templates instructional vs. highlight and an
A/B plan: same clip posted as Reel with A broad+trend tags and B niche
skill tags 24 hours later, tracking reach, saves, and watch time. AI also
reminded me to avoid banned/blocked tags, keep tags in the caption not
comments, lead with keywords in the first 2 lines, and keep reels 7–12s or
20–30s with a strong hook in the first 1–2 seconds.

Results so far niche skill tags produced higher saves and completion rate,
while broad tags increased impressions but lower retention. I’m keeping a
sheet of posts, tag sets, and metrics.
