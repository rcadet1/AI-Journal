Week 3
This week I used AI to study for my first math test. I asked ChatGPT to make a
targeted study plan from my syllabus topics limits, derivative rules power,
product, quotient, chain implicit differentiation, basic optimization, and
exponential and log derivatives. I did not use AI during the test. I used it only
to generate practice and to check my work. 

I had ChatGPT (1) create 20 mixed practice problems with increasing difficulty,
(2) hide the answers so I could attempt them first, then (3) show step by step
solutions with common mistake callouts. I also asked it to produce “contrast”
examples e.g., when to use product rule vs. chain rule) and very short
checklists: “If f(x)=…, what should I try first?” For limits, it gave me a
decision tree (factor/rationalize/conjugate/L’Hôpital) and I practiced each
branch. When I made errors, I pasted my steps and asked for a pinpointed
diagnosis instead of a full re solve so I could correct the exact line.

I used AI to build a one page formula sheet from my notes no new formulas,
sorted by trigger words “composition chain,” “ratio of functions quotient,”
“unfactored polynomial limit factor,” etc. It also converted a few answers to
graph sketches and verbal interpretations so I could check conceptual
understanding sign of f', extrema tests, units on rates.
