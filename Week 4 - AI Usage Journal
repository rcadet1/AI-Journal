Week 4
This week I continued my internship search and used ChatGPT to speed up the
research + application workflow. I asked AI to (1) scan 6 postings and extract
must have vs. nice to have skills, (2) map those to my coursework and projects,
(3) rewrite 4 résumé bullets with measurable outcomes, and (4) draft concise
300 400 char answers to Why this role/company? for applications with tight
text boxes. I did not let AI submit applications or contact recruiters for me.
I edited every line and verified all metrics myself. 

I also had ChatGPT build a simple tracker schema company, role, deadline, status,
referral, interview stage, follow up date, notes and a formula to flag overdue
follow ups. I also used it to generate polite bump messages for alumni and a
start template for behavioral answers focused on my TA work and Classroom
Support job. For postings that looked vague, AI helped me translate the JD into
3-5 concrete weekly tasks so I could tailor my bullets truthfully.
