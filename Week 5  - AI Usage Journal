Week 5
This week I kept pushing my internship search and used ChatGPT to tighten my
applications. I asked AI to extract core skills from 8 postings risk, ops,
analyst, HR people analytics and map them to my coursework and campus roles.
It helped me tailor bullets with numbers and write 300-400 char Why this role
snippets. I didn’t let AI submit apps or message recruiters for me I edited and
verified everything.

I applied to Progressive and got a first round interview. I used ChatGPT to
generate a role specific interview guide company snapshot, recent news,
competency themes, then practiced 6 START stories TA/WEI/Classroom Support.
The interview felt mixed I answered clearly on teamwork and prioritization but
I rambled on one analytics question and my tie back to the role could’ve been
tighter. I wrote a thank you email using an AI outline but in my own words and
sent it same day.
