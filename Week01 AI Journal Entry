Week 1
This week I used AI while working on my job & internship search. I asked AI to
summarize roles, extract keywords from postings, rewrite résumé bullets with
stronger verbs and numbers, outline short cover letters, and practice
behavioral interview questions. I did not let AI apply or message people for
me. I wrote and edited the final drafts myself and used AI only for ideation
and proofreading. Here are my chat links: [paste links here].

I also used AI to help organize tasks into a simple application tracker and to
translate job descriptions into concrete requirements that I used to tailor my
résumé for three target roles. AI flagged vague START answers and suggested
clearer metrics I could verify from my own work.

I tried out other tools this week, including LinkedIn’s “AI coach.” The output
was generic compared to ChatGPT, which gave more actionable edits when I fed
it my résumé and the actual postings. I learned to give specific prompts and
avoid sharing sensitive data.

Takeaways: keep bullets short, specific, and quantifiable; verify every claim;
and track applications in one place. Next week I will tailor my résumé to
three roles, run five more mock interviews, and contact two alumni at UMD.
