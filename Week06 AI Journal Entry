Week 6
This week I used ChatGPT to get unstuck on a small Python script. I was cleaning
a CSV of player stats and computing slugging percentage. My loop kept throwing
KeyError and my results didn’t match Excel. I did not ask AI to write the whole
program. I used it to debug, explain the traceback, and suggest safer patterns.

What I asked for:
• “Read this error and tell me what line actually failed.”  
• “Why would pandas say a column doesn’t exist even though I see it?”  
• “Show me a vectorized way to compute SLG with null/zero at bats handled.”  
• “Give me a tiny test I can run to verify the math.”

What I changed after the chat:
1) The CSV had hidden spaces in headers. I added:
   `df.columns = df.columns.str.strip()`  
2) Some fields were strings with commas. I converted and filled safely:
   `num_cols = ["AB","H","2B","3B","HR"]; df[num_cols] = (df[num_cols]
      .replace({",":""}, regex=True).apply(pd.to_numeric, errors="coerce").fillna(0))`
3) I replaced the loop with a vectorized formula and divide by zero guard:
   `tb = df["H"] + df["2B"] + 2*df["3B"] + 3*df["HR"]`
   `df["SLG"] = np.where(df["AB"]>0, tb/df["AB"], 0.0)`
4) I added a 3 row unit test snippet and a quick `assert np.isclose()`
