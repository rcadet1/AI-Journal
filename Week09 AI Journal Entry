This week I used ChatGPT to build a simple portfolio for my projects. It
suggested React + Vite + Tailwind and gave me a clean one page layout:
hero, projects grid, about, and contact. I used a JSON file for project
data so I can add cards without editing code. I copied the code, edited
text and styles, and try to pushed it to GitHub. 

AI helped me fix two blockers. First, a GitHub Pages refresh error:
I set the correct base in vite.config and added the redirect file.
Second, performance and access: lazy loaded images, added alt text,
and set a short meta title and description.

What I learned a data file keeps updates simple Pages needs the base
path set small details alt text, spacing, clear buttons make the site
feel real. Next steps: add 3 real projects with screenshots, write a
3 sentence case study for each problem, approach, result, and connect
a custom domain.
