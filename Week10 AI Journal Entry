Week 10 
This week I used ChatGPT to speed up how I make JPG images for video editing.
I asked for fast batch commands to convert and size files for Reels, TikTok and
YouTube. It gave me an ffmpeg one liner that turns mixed PNG, HEIC shots into
JPG, resizes to 1080×1920 or 1920×1080, sets quality 85, converts color
to sRGB, strips metadata, and auto names with zero padded numbers so Premiere
and CapCut sort correctly. I also had it write a short Python script Pillow
to add a thin border and optional text overlay title and timestamp. I copied
the code, tested on a sample folder.
